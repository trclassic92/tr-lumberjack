## About This Resource
Our resource features a built-in delivery system designed to offer players a seamless and efficient way to earn money without the burden of hard labor. To utilize this feature, simply speak with the contractor, select the Delivery Truck option, and embark on your task.

Additionally, we have introduced a work van equipped with a compact trailer that attaches to the Bison vehicle. This setup provides players with extra storage capacity, allowing them to transport chopped logs from trees and carry a larger quantity of crafting parts. This flexibility enables players to not only sell their materials but also use them for crafting various items, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
